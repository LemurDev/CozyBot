# What is CozyBot?

CozyBot is a Twitch bot based on **COZYNESS**!! This bot is mainly being developed by Lemur and Billy. But, we are more than happy to see the community join in!

# Setup

Install requirements via requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file. In this file you need two variables:
- TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN
- TWITCH_CHANNEL_NAME

Token will be generated from [Token Generator](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/)

Assign a channel name you want the bot to start in

# Running the Bot

## Windows

**Currently being worked on.**

## Linux

```bash
./run_liunx
```
This will run the Twitch bot for you. Make sure you follow the setup instructions!

# Display on Stream

CozyBot will output to a file named `cozy.txt`. The value will only change **IF** the cozyness is higher than before. You could then read from this text file to display the highest cozyness.
